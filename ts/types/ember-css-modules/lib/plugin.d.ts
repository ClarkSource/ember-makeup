   * Given a config hash, adds the given PostCSS plugins to that configuration,

   * within the `config` hook.
   *
   * `after` and `postprocess` plugins are inserted after already registered
   * plugins.
   * `before` plugins are prepended to already registered plugins. This means
   * for before that if you called this method with plugins that are dependent
   * on order of execution, you would either have to register the plugin that
   * needs to be executed last as the first plugin, like so:
   *
   * ```js
   * class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
   *   config(env, baseConfig) {
   *     this.addPostcssPlugin(baseConfig, 'before', require('postcss-nested'));
   *
   *     // needs to be executed *before* `postcss-nested` and is thus registered, *after* it
   *     this.addPostcssPlugin(baseConfig, 'before', require('postcss-nested-ancestors'));
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Because this is confusing, you should rather pass both plugins in one go,
   * like so:
   *
   * ```js
   * class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
   *   config(env, baseConfig) {
   *     this.addPostcssPlugin(
   *       baseConfig,
   *       'before',
   *       require('postcss-nested-ancestors'),
   *       require('postcss-nested')
   *     );
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * `addPostcssPlugin` is variadic and accepts as many plugins as you like.
   * The order is preserved, when passing all plugins in one go.
   *
   * @param config
   * @param type
   * @param plugins
